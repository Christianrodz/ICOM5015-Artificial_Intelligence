# Is Python Fast or Slow?

The purpose of this assignment is to visualize the importance of using Python libraries. You should set up an experiment to compare the two cases described below:

Write code in Python (using iteration) to carry out the product of 1-D and 2-D arrays whose dimensions should be compatible for the product to be carried out. Time the execution of your code for several cases, v. g. small arrays with dimensionalities less than 10; then try arrays with dimensionalities in the range of several tens; and then try arrays with dimensionalities in the range of several hundreds. Try it for several combination of products of arrays.
In this second part, import NumPy, and use its operations to carry out the product of the same arrays used in 1. Time the execution.
Compare the results and explain the reason for the difference in processing time. Use appropriate tables and graphics for your comparison. 
How does processing time grows with the dimensionalities of the arrays? 
How does processing time varies between vectors (1-D Arrays) and matrices (2-D Arrays) without NumPy vs with NumPy? Find out why the difference. 
What language or languages were used for developing the NumPy library?
